A version of RTKLIB optimized for single and dual frequency low cost GPS receivers, especially u-blox receivers.  It is based on RTKLIB 2.4.3 and is kept reasonably closely synced to that branch.   This software is provided “AS IS” without any warranties of any kind so please be careful, especially if using it in any kind of real-time application.  

Binaries and tutorials for this code, and sample GPS data sets are available at http://rtkexplorer.com/  

The latest version of the user manual is at: https://github.com/rtklibexplorer/RTKLIB/blob/demo5/doc/manual_demo5.pdf
